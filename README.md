# MovieCatalog
My second android project used as a submission for dicoding academy. This project mainly worked on API, database, and scheduled works. Widget and notification also are added for extra features.

Here are the main things that i learned to use in this project:
- API
- JSON objects
- Database (SQlite)
- Content provider
- Widget
- Alarm manager
- Notification
- Shared preferences
